# polynomial_regression_p5_tf
A visualization of polynomial regression using the tensorflow library.

This project is an **extension** from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIXDik5SGsI) in which [Danial Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/) teaches about polynomial regression using tensorflow library. 

**My additions to this project are:-**
1. A slider that can alter the learning rate of the algorithm.
2. A dropdown from which you can select different optimisers, namely **adam delta** and **stochastic gradient descent**.

Here is a snapshot of the project.
